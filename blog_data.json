        "Creating Your First React TS Project in Visual Studio Code",
        "<h3>Introduction</h3><br>So, you want to get into React TypeScript (TS), but you're unsure of the best way to create a project and get started. You've come to the right article. Usually, people get into React TS because it's a part of the web development full stack development, or specifically, front-end web development.<br><br>In this tutorial, we will create a new React project in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), using the command prompt and NPM (Node Project Manager) from Node.js.<br><br>Without further ado, let's proceed.<br><br><h3>Requirements</h3><br>Before we get started, we need to install node.js, as it includes NPM, which is mandatory for the steps below to work.<br>Click <a href='https://nodejs.org/'>here</a> to install the latest version of Node.js. Once this is installed, you can now continue.<br><br><h3>Steps</h3><br>Please note that the following steps are from a Windows 11 user. Some of these steps may have to be altered to work on other operating systems.<br><br><ol><br>    <li>Open the terminal/command prompt or whatever operating system (OS) you're on.</li><br>    <li>Type <code style='color: green;'>cd</code>, followed by the path to the chosen directory.</li><br>    <li>Type <code style='color: green;'>npm create vite@latest</code></li><br>    <li>If any packages need installing, you'll see the name of those packages, followed by 'Ok to proceed? (y)'. Simply type 'y', press enter, and it will install the packages mentioned.<br><br>    <li>Enter your project's name. The default name here is <code style='color: green;'>vite-project</code>, as shown on the terminal.</li><br>    <li>Now, using your arrow keys, from the list of frameworks, select 'React', then press <code style='color: green;'>ENTER</code> to confirm.</li><br>    <li>From the variants list, using your arrow keys again, select 'TypeScript', then press <code style='color: green;'>ENTER</code> to confirm.</li><br>    <li>You should see three commands that need to be run, in that order:</li><br><br>    <code style='color: green;'>cd [name of your project]</code><br><br>    <code style='color: green;'>npm install</code><br><br>    <code style='color: green;'>npm run dev</code><br>    <br>    <li>Open VS Code, then on the nav bar, go to File -> Open Folder, and search for your project. Once found, select it, and the generated skeleton code should be generated.</li><br>    <li>Open the terminal, either using Ctrl+i, or on the nav bar, select Terminal -> New Terminal.</li><br>    <li>Enter the three commands, one at a time, into the terminal. When the third command (<code style='color: green;'>npm run dev</code>) is entered, you'll be given a Localhost link, and, when selected, will run your project.</li><br>    <li>To stop the localhost, click on the terminal and press Ctrl+C.</li><br></ol><br><br><h3>Conclusion</h3><br>Now that you've got some skeleton code to start your React TS project, my recommendation now would be to do the following:<br><ol><br>    <li>Play around with the contents of each file in the `src` folder</li><br>    <li>Look up further readings or videos on React.</li><br></ol><br>If you're unsure of what video to watch first, I'd highly recommendation <a href='https://youtu.be/SqcY0GlETPk?si=lrya4JJX-GGKJoC0'>this video</a>, created by Programming with Mosh on YouTube, if you're a total beginner at React.<br>This article was actually inspired by this video tutorial.<br><br>Thank you very much for reading! And I hope it has helped you get a good start into ReactTS.",

        "20+ Intriguing Writing Prompts to Inspire You to Start Writing Today",
        "It's difficult to find inspiration as a creative writer, especially if you wish to get into creative writing, or the creative industry in general. If you're feeling a little low on inspiration, you've come to the right article! I've compiled a list of completely random writing prompts, of all genres, for you to be inspired and to start writing short & fictitious stories today.<br><br>One piece of advice I like to give to writers is to always remember to <b>write what you would like to read!</b> Whether that's murder mysteries, or science-fiction, it's your canvas, you write whatever you want.<br><br>Without further ado, let's look at the list!<br><ol><br><li>'He was invited to have an exclusive interview with the CEO'</li><br><li>'Stop calling me, Matthew. I've had enough'</li><br><li>'Her husband accidentally sent her a text that was meant for his mistress'</li><br><li>'A homicide detective by day, a sleepwalking murderer by night'</li><br><li>'She had to get to the bottom of this deepest secret of her boyfriend's family'</li><br><li>'Technology has now become illegal. He must find a way to bring it back'</li><br><li>'She ate a croissant for breakfast every day'</li><br><li>'He develops a new device that he can implant into his ear that reads the minds of those they focus on'</li><br><li>'Selena got a email from an old school teacher'</li><br><li>'Two friends have a disagreement, and the arguments gets rather heated'</li><br><li>'Diary of a teenager going into adulthood'</li><br><li>'He got a call from a unknown phone number'</li><br><li>'She continuously called him. Continuously asking'</li><br><li>'A young man enters his local library, and thinks to himself, 'Do we still need libraries?''</li><br><li>'Her prom date went ...not so well'</li><br><li>'The exact same person appeared in every single one of her dreams'</li><br><li>'She grew from being clingy... to being independent'</li><br><li>'Their grandparents turned 100 years old today'</li><br><li>'It is Andrew's wedding day. While the vows are being said, someone from the crowd yells, 'I object!''</li><br><li>'I remember the time when...'</li><br><li>'Shame - something he wouldn't be happy to say out loud.'</li><br><li>'Two characters meet for the first time, and one of them has a secret'</li><br></ol><br>As well as the above list, I've also got 2 pieces of advice for writers!<br><br><h3>Advice #1</h3><br>It can also be rather difficult to find spare time to be able to sit and begin writing, even if you have a lot of prompts to write about. I struggle to get time to pursue my hobby of creative writing, as I've been focusing more on my career that hobbies.<br><br>A good way to practise your writing throughout your day is by journaling what you've been up to. Like you're the main character of the story, and you're simply writing about life as it happens, while also noting down how you feel in the moment. Personally, I tend to do some journaling when anything happens, like meeting up with friends or attending a funeral. However, if you like fictional creative writing, you could still journal, but add some creative twists to the diary, from the POV of one of your characters.<br><h3>Advice #2</h3><br>But, what if <b>none</b> of the prompts in the above list are that intriguing to you? That's not a problem, dear writer! A fun little activity is what I like to call 'freestyle writing'.<br><br>This is how it works: You write for 3 to 5 minutes whatever spills out of your head, donâ€™t think too much. Then, you pick the most interesting phrase from that freestyle writing session and write a 10 line monologue inspired by the phrase.<br><br>If you found this article helpful, be sure to come back again for more creative writing articles here at JJDBlogs.",
