        "20+ Intriguing Writing Prompts to Inspire You to Start Writing Today",
        "It's difficult to find inspiration as a creative writer, especially if you wish to get into creative writing, or the creative industry in general. If you're feeling a little low on inspiration, you've come to the right article! I've compiled a list of completely random writing prompts, of all genres, for you to be inspired and to start writing short & fictitious stories today.<br>One piece of advice I like to give to writers is to always remember to <b>write what you would like to read!</b> Whether that's murder mysteries, or science-fiction, it's your canvas, you write whatever you want.<br>Without further ado, let's look at the list!<br><ol><br><li>'He was invited to have an exclusive interview with the CEO'</li><br><li>'Stop calling me, Matthew. I've had enough'</li><br><li>'Her husband accidentally sent her a text that was meant for his mistress'</li><br><li>'A homicide detective by day, a sleepwalking murderer by night'</li><br><li>'She had to get to the bottom of this deepest secret of her boyfriend's family'</li><br><li>'Technology has now become illegal. He must find a way to bring it back'</li><br><li>'She ate a croissant for breakfast every day'</li><br><li>'He develops a new device that he can implant into his ear that reads the minds of those they focus on'</li><br><li>'Selena got a email from an old school teacher'</li><br><li>'Two friends have a disagreement, and the arguments gets rather heated'</li><br><li>'Diary of a teenager going into adulthood'</li><br><li>'He got a call from a unknown phone number'</li><br><li>'She continuously called him. Continuously asking'</li><br><li>'A young man enters his local library, and thinks to himself, 'Do we still need libraries?''</li><br><li>'Her prom date went ...not so well'</li><br><li>'The exact same person appeared in every single one of her dreams'</li><br><li>'She grew from being clingy... to being independent'</li><br><li>'Their grandparents turned 100 years old today'</li><br><li>'It is Andrew's wedding day. While the vows are being said, someone from the crowd yells, 'I object!''</li><br><li>'I remember the time when...'</li><br><li>'Shame - something he wouldn't be happy to say out loud.'</li><br><li>'Two characters meet for the first time, and one of them has a secret'</li><br></ol><br>As well as the above list, I've also got 2 pieces of advice for writers!<br><br><h3>Advice #1</h3><br>It can also be rather difficult to find spare time to be able to sit and begin writing, even if you have a lot of prompts to write about. I struggle to get time to pursue my hobby of creative writing, as I've been focusing more on my career that hobbies.<br>A good way to practise your writing throughout your day is by journaling what you've been up to. Like you're the main character of the story, and you're simply writing about life as it happens, while also noting down how you feel in the moment. Personally, I tend to do some journaling when anything happens, like meeting up with friends or attending a funeral. However, if you like fictional creative writing, you could still journal, but add some creative twists to the diary, from the POV of one of your characters.<br><h3>Advice #2</h3><br>But, what if <b>none</b> of the prompts in the above list are that intriguing to you? That's not a problem, dear writer! A fun little activity is what I like to call 'freestyle writing'.<br>This is how it works: You write for 3 to 5 minutes whatever spills out of your head, donâ€™t think too much. Then, you pick the most interesting phrase from that freestyle writing session and write a 10 line monologue inspired by the phrase.<br><br>If you found this article helpful, be sure to come back again for more creative writing articles here at JJDBlogs.",

        "6 Reasons Why I Quit Using Online Website Builders",
        "As a web developer, there have been times where I've decided to use an online website builder since I thought my designs were terrible, and not to a high standards. Take JJDBlogs as an example. It used to have just a simple, bright purple background, which I thought was boring. So, I gave it a gradient and I do like the new design now. Small changes, like the gradient, and colour changing when hovering over a button, do so much for your website, so I wanted to experiment more with it.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, they are fast to create these website, as you simply drag and drop elements into the places you want them to be in. Plus, with Artificial Intelligence roaming around, it's never been easier to make a website. However, AI can still make mistakes, so making a large website can be challenging with a free AI model, and you'd be spending more money on a 'more advanced' model to code anythced' model to code anything you want it too.<br><br>With that being said, here are my 6 reasons for not using online website builders:<br><br><ol><br><li>You can create some stunning designs just by using simple pieces of HTML and CSS code, and these languages are so easy to learn. There's hundreds of tutorials out there for HTML and CSS at all levels, and thousands of UI designs to get inspired by.</li><br><br><li>Website builders nowadays can be very pricey, and even if it's free to create a website, you'd still have to pay for a custom domain name. Well, you need to pay for a custom domain anyways, so why waste more money on website builders if you're planning on buying a custom domain from websites like <a href='https://www.ionos.co.uk/'>IONOS</a>?</li><br><br><li>When creating websites from scratch, without a tutorial, just practising existing knowledge, the website feels more personal and tailored towards yourself. It can feel really rewarding too being able to design and develop your own custom website, without having all the nonsense of a website builder. Not only that, but you also get practical with your knowledge and put it towards a great website idea. Developers are always seeking projects to work on that, not only can they be added to their portfolio, but gives them an opportunity to use their skills practically.</li><br><br><li>If you wanted to start a business creating websites for clients, why use an online website builder to create them for your customers? When they see your results, the majority of clients won't come to you again, since they'll find out that you didn't code it yourself. It's similar to AI 'Artists' trying to sell off art that they didn't even draw. They just typed in some words, and the AI just does everything else. It's just lazy.</li><br><br><li>There may be limited options on a website builder. If you wanted some sort of animation, it may only be a paid feature, meaning you'd be wasting money on a feature that could easily be implemented in CSS.</li><br><br><li>You don't need to pay loads for a code editor. Integrated Development Environments (IDE) such as VS Code are jam-packed with features for literally any language. Or, Notepad++ is simple, but allows you to code and execute your work.</li><br></ol><br><br>These are my own personal opinions, if you agree or not, that's perfectly fine!",
